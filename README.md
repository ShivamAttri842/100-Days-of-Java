# **ðŸš€ 100 Days of Java Challenge**
Welcome to my 100 Days of Java challenge! ðŸŽ‰

Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding daily in Java, learning new concepts, and sharing my progress here on GitHub. This journey will include everything from the basics of Java to advanced topics like data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more!

# **ðŸ“… Goals:**
Day 1-10: Java Basics â€“ variables, loops, conditionals, and input/output.
Day 11-30: Object-Oriented Programming â€“ classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
Day 31-50: Data Structures â€“ arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and more.
Day 51-70: Algorithms â€“ searching, sorting, recursion.
Day 71-90: Advanced Java â€“ threads, exceptions, file handling.
Day 91-100: Projects â€“ Building real-world projects and applying what I've learned.

# **ðŸ“Œ Why Java?**
Java is a powerful, widely-used programming language with a strong community. By mastering Java, I'll be better equipped for software development, backend systems, Android development, and more.

# **ðŸŒŸ Follow My Progress**
I'll be committing my code daily, so feel free to follow along, give feedback, and join me on this journey!

Let's get started! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
