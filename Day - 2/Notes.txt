The Scanner class in Java is a simple tool used to get input from the user, like typing from the keyboard.

How it works:
Creating a Scanner: You create a Scanner object to start reading input.

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.in means you're reading input from the keyboard.
Reading Input: You can use different methods to read different types of input:

nextInt()       to read an integer.
nextLine()      to read a full line of text.
nextFloat()     to read a decimal number.


Example: In your code:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);    creates the scanner to take input from the keyboard.
int a = sc.nextInt();                   waits for the user to type an integer.
System.out.println(a);                  prints the number the user typed.


Closing the Scanner:                    After you're done, you should close the scanner:
sc.close();

Simple Example:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter your age: ");
int age = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");
sc.close();
