1. Arithmetic Operators:
Definition: Used to perform basic mathematical operations.

Operators:

+ (Addition): Adds two operands.
- (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
* (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
/ (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
% (Modulus): Returns the remainder of division.




2. Unary Operators:
Definition: Operators that operate on only one operand.

Operators:

+ (Unary plus): Represents a positive value.
- (Unary minus): Negates a value (changes the sign).
++ (Increment): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
Prefix (++a): Increments first, then uses the value.
Postfix (a++): Uses the value first, then increments.
-- (Decrement): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
Prefix (--a): Decrements first, then uses the value.
Postfix (a--): Uses the value first, then decrements.
! (Logical NOT): Inverts a boolean value.




3. Relational Operators:
Definition: Used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them.

Operators:

== (Equal to): Returns true if both operands are equal.
!= (Not equal to): Returns true if operands are not equal.
> (Greater than): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right.
< (Less than): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right.
>= (Greater than or equal to): Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
<= (Less than or equal to): Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.




4. Logical Operators:
Definition: Used to perform logical operations on boolean expressions.

Operators:

&& (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
|| (Logical OR): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
! (Logical NOT): Inverts the boolean value.
